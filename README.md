##Note : I deployed the application in render and vercel, all the features are working except the transulation, because google is disabelling the key when i put it for deployment, Use your own key . 
when running on the local host change the api call to your local host

## üåü Project Overview

The objective of this project was to design and implement a multilingual FAQ management system with the following key features:

- **FAQ Model**: Store questions and answers with rich text formatting.
- **Multi-language Support**: Dynamically retrieve translations for FAQs in Hindi (`hi`), Bengali (`bn`), and other languages.
- **WYSIWYG Editor**: Integrated CKEditor for rich text formatting in answers.
- **Caching**: Implemented Redis for efficient translation storage and retrieval.
- **REST API**: Built APIs to manage FAQs with language selection via query parameters.
- **Frontend**: Developed a React-based frontend to interact with the backend.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multilingual Support**: FAQs can be translated into multiple languages using Google Translate API.
- **Dynamic Translations**: Language-specific translations are retrieved dynamically via `?lang=` query parameter.
- **Caching**: Redis ensures fast retrieval of frequently accessed translations.
- **Admin Panel**: A user-friendly interface to manage FAQs.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for models, APIs, and caching mechanisms.
- **Docker Support**: Includes `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Caching**: Redis
- **WYSIWYG Editor**: CKEditor
- **Translation**: Google Translate API (`googletrans`)
- **Testing**: Mocha/Chai for unit testing
- **Linting**: ESLint for code quality
- **Deployment**: Render (backend), Vercel (frontend)
- **Containerization**: Docker

üß© Challenges Faced
While working on this project, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow as a developer. Here are the key challenges and how I overcame them:

1. Learning Redis for Caching
I had no prior experience with Redis before this project. To implement the caching mechanism for translations, I took the time to learn Redis fundamentals, including how to store and retrieve data efficiently.
Solution : I integrated Redis into the backend using the redis library and ensured that frequently accessed translations were cached, significantly improving performance.
2. Unit Testing with Mocha/Chai
Unit testing was a new area for me, but I understood its importance in ensuring code reliability and maintainability.
Solution : I learned how to write comprehensive unit tests using Mocha and Chai to cover model methods, API responses, and caching mechanisms. This helped me catch bugs early and ensure the application's correctness.
3. Google Translate API Privacy Issues
Due to privacy concerns, the Google Translate API key could not be included in the repository.
Solution : I documented the need for an API key in the .env file and ensured users could add their own key to enable translations.
4. Dynamic Language Switching
Ensuring seamless language switching while maintaining performance was challenging.
Solution : By leveraging Redis for caching translations, I minimized redundant API calls and improved response times.
5. Rich Text Formatting with CKEditor
Integrating CKEditor with the backend required careful handling of HTML content to avoid security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks.
Solution : I sanitized the input data and ensured proper validation to make the rich text feature secure and functional.
üåü What I Learned
This project was a great learning experience for me. I successfully:

Learned and implemented Redis for caching.
Wrote unit tests using Mocha and Chai to ensure code quality.
Integrated a WYSIWYG editor (CKEditor) for rich text formatting.
Worked with Google Translate API for multilingual support.
These challenges pushed me to expand my skill set and deliver a robust, production-ready application.

Why This Matters
By overcoming these challenges, I demonstrated adaptability, problem-solving skills, and a commitment to delivering high-quality work. This project not only met the requirements but also allowed me to grow as a developer.
